/**
 * Pattern: Immutable Object with Volatile Reference
 * <p>
 * Motivations: Mutable state is troublesome in concurrent environments for
 * being vulnerable to visibility and atomic related hazards, like inconsistent
 * state objects, lost updates, stale values and others. An Immutable objects is
 * one whose status does not mutate after constructed, and so is thread-safe.
 * IMPORTANT: references to immutable objects are not thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Intent: Make all fields final and don't use any method that can mutate the
 * internal state of the object; don't expose the object until it's full
 * created; make the class final, prohibiting extension. It's important to refer
 * to an immutable object using a volatile field, because it has visibility
 * guarantees (every change to the immutable object variable will be made
 * visible to all threads), and any synchronizing mechanism to ensure
 * thread-safety for the reference.
 * <p>
 * Applicability: When sharing a object, use Immutable Objects being referenced
 * by a volatile fields whatever it's possible.
